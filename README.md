this is a short project made in threejs to load an interactive planet model around that has interactive points on it

available [here](https://insertokname.github.io/planet/)

**note:** threeJs is has problems rendering on lower end hardware and may not load or take a few seconds to load. Will optimize in the future to load on lower end hardware.
